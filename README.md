# GifTastic

This app starts out with a few different categories of gifs for you to play around with. Click on the different buttons (labeled with their individual category) to see gifs related to that topic. If those topics don't interest you, you can also add your own topics to see gifs related to your favorite categories. You can add as many as you like. Have fun!
